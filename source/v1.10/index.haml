%h2 What is Bundler?

%p#intro
  Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking
  and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.
  %br
  %br
  Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems
  you need are present in development, staging, and production.
  Starting work on a project is as simple as <code>bundle install</code>.

        Getting started with bundler is easy! Open a terminal window and run this command:
    :code
      $ gem install bundler

  .bullet
    .description
      %p
        Specify your dependencies in a Gemfile in your project's root:
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      source 'https://rubygems.org'
      gem 'nokogiri'
      gem 'rack', '~>1.1'
      gem 'rspec', :require => 'spec'
    = link_to 'Learn More: Gemfiles', './gemfile.html'

  .bullet
    .description
      %p
        Install all of the required gems from your specified sources:
    :code
      $ bundle install
      $ git add Gemfile Gemfile.lock
    = link_to 'Learn More: bundle install', './bundle_install.html'
    .notes
      %p
        The second command adds the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to your repository. This ensures
        that other developers on your app, as well as your deployment environment, will all use
        the same third-party code that you are using now.

        Inside your app, load up the bundled environment:
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      require 'rubygems'
      require 'bundler/setup'

      # require your gems as usual
      require 'nokogiri'
    = link_to 'Learn More: Bundler.setup', './bundler_setup.html'

      %p
        Run an executable that comes with a gem in your bundle:
    :code
      $ bundle exec rspec spec/models
    .notes
      %p
        In some cases, running executables without <code>bundle exec</code>
        may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system
        and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
      %p
        However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain.
        Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or
        on another machine.

    .description
      %p
        Finally, if you want a way to get a shortcut to gems in your bundle:
    :code
      $ bundle install --binstubs
      $ bin/rspec spec/models
    .notes
      %p
        The executables installed into <code>bin</code> are scoped to the
        bundle, and will always work.

%h2#create-gem Create a rubygem with Bundler

%p
  Bundler is also an easy way to create new gems. Just like you might create a standard Rails project using <code>rails new</code>, you can create a standard gem project with <code>bundle gem</code>.

      Create a new gem with a README, .gemspec, Rakefile, directory structure, and all the basic boilerplate you need to describe, test, and publish a gem:
  :code
    $ bundle gem my_gem
    Creating gem 'my_gem'...
          create  my_gem/Gemfile
          create  my_gem/.gitignore
          create  my_gem/lib/my_gem.rb
          create  my_gem/lib/my_gem/version.rb
          create  my_gem/my_gem.gemspec
          create  my_gem/Rakefile
          create  my_gem/README.md
          create  my_gem/bin/console
          create  my_gem/bin/setup
          create  my_gem/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
          create  my_gem/LICENSE.txt
          create  my_gem/.travis.yml
          create  my_gem/test/test_helper.rb
          create  my_gem/test/my_gem_test.rb
    Initializing git repo in ./my_gem
