      if you would normally use sudo to install gems.
    .how
      :code
        $ gem install rails
      .notes
        We recommend using rvm for dependable Ruby
        installations, especially if you are switching

      Add new dependencies to your Gemfile as you
      need them.

      # lang: ruby
      gem 'nokogiri'
      gem 'geokit'

    .description
      If you want a dependency to be loaded only in
      a certain Rails environment, place it in a group
      named after that Rails environment
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      group :test do
        gem 'rspec'
        gem 'faker'
      end

      You can place a dependency in multiple groups
      at once as well
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      group :development, :test do
        gem 'wirble'
        gem 'ruby-debug'
      end
    = link_to 'Learn More: Groups', './groups.html'

    .description
      After adding a dependency, if it is not yet
      installed, install it
    .how
      :code
        $ bundle install
      .notes
        This will update all dependencies in your
        Gemfile to the latest versions that do not
        conflict with other dependencies
