              Bundler's Purpose and Rationale
            </h2>
            <p>
              We designed bundler to make it easy to share your code across a number of development,
              staging and production machines. Of course, you know how to share your own application
              or gem: stick it on GitHub and clone it where you need it. Bundler makes it easy to
              make sure that your application has the dependencies it needs to start up and run without
              errors.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, you declare these dependencies in a file at the root of your application, called
              <code>Gemfile</code>. It looks something like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rails'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'3.0.0.rc'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rack-cache'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'nokogiri'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.4.2'</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              This <code>Gemfile</code> says a few things. First, it says that bundler should look for gems
              declared in the <code>Gemfile</code> at <code>https://rubygems.org</code>. You can declare
              multiple RubyGems sources, and bundler will look for gems in the order you declared the
              sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you declare a few dependencies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>on version <code>3.0.0.rc</code> of <code>rails</code></li>
              <li>on any version of <code>rack-cache</code></li>
              <li>on a version of <code>nokogiri</code> that is <code>>= 1.4.2</code> but <code>< 1.5.0</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After declaring your first set of dependencies, you tell bundler to go get them:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install    # &lt;code&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              Bundler will connect to <code>rubygems.org</code> (and any other sources that you declared),
              and find a list of all of the required gems that meet the requirements you specified. Because
              all of the gems in your <code>Gemfile</code> have dependencies of their own (and some of
              those have their own dependencies), running <code>bundle install</code> on the
              <code>Gemfile</code> above will install quite a few gems.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any of the needed gems are already installed, Bundler will use them. After installing
              any needed gems to your system, bundler writes a snapshot of all of the gems and
              versions that it installed to <code>Gemfile.lock</code>.
            </p>
            <h2 id='setting-up-your-application-to-use-bundler'>
              Setting Up Your Application to Use Bundler
            </h2>
            <p>
              Bundler makes sure that Ruby can find all of the gems in the <code>Gemfile</code>
              (and all of their dependencies). If your app is a Rails 3 app, your default application
              already has the code necessary to invoke bundler. If it is a Rails 2.3 app, please see
              <a href="./rails23.html">Setting up Bundler in Rails 2.3</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For another kind of application (such as a Sinatra application), you will need to set up
              bundler before trying to require any gems. At the top of the first file that your
              application loads (for Sinatra, the file that calls <code>require 'sinatra'</code>), put
              the following code:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rubygems'</span>&#x000A;<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'bundler/setup'</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              This will automatically discover your <code>Gemfile</code>, and make all of the gems in
              your <code>Gemfile</code> available to Ruby (in technical terms, it puts the gems "on the
              load path"). You can think of it as an adding some extra powers to <code>require&#x000A;    'rubygems'</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that your code is available to Ruby, you can require the gems that you need. For
              instance, you can <code>require 'sinatra'</code>. If you have a lot of dependencies, you
              might want to say "require all of the gems in my <code>Gemfile</code>". To do this, put
              the following code immediately following <code>require 'bundler/setup'</code>:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="no">Bundler</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:default</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            For our example Gemfile, this line is exactly equivalent to:
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rails'</span>&#x000A;<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rack-cache'</span>&#x000A;<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'nokogiri'</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              Astute readers will notice that the correct way to require the <code>rack-cache</code>
              gem is <code>require 'rack/cache'</code>, not <code>require 'rack-cache'</code>. To tell
              bundler to use <code>require 'rack/cache'</code>, update your Gemfile:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rails'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'3.0.0.rc'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rack-cache'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:require</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'rack/cache'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'nokogiri'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.4.2'</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              For such a small <code>Gemfile</code>, we'd advise you to skip
              <code>Bundler.require</code> and just require the gems by hand (especially given the
              need to put in a <code>:require</code> directive in the <code>Gemfile</code>). For much
              larger <code>Gemfile</code>s, using <code>Bundler.require</code> allows you to skip
              repeating a large stack of requirements.
            </p>
            <h2 id='grouping-your-dependencies'>
              Grouping Your Dependencies
            </h2>
            <p>
              You'll sometimes have groups of gems that only make sense in particular environments.
              For instance, you might develop your app (at an early stage) using SQLite, but deploy it
              using <code>mysql2</code> or <code>pg</code>. In this example, you might not have MySQL
              or Postgres installed on your development machine, and want bundler to skip it.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, you can group your dependencies:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rails'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'3.2.2'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rack-cache'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:require</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'rack/cache'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'nokogiri'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.4.2'</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:development</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'sqlite3'</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:production</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'pg'</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              Now, in development, you can instruct bundler to skip the <code>production</code> group:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install --without production&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              Bundler will remember that you installed the gems using <code>--without&#x000A;    production</code>. For curious readers, bundler stores the flag in
              <code>APP_ROOT/.bundle/config</code>. You can see all of the settings that bundler saved
              there by running <code>bundle config</code>, which will also print out global settings
              (stored in <code>~/.bundle/config</code>), and settings set via environment variables.
              For more information on configuring bundler, please see
              <a href="/bundler-site/v1.1/man/bundle-config.1.html">bundle config</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you run <code>bundle install</code> later, without any flag, bundler will remember
              that you last called <code>bundle install --without production</code>, and use that flag
              again. When you <code>require 'bundler/setup'</code>, bundler will ignore gems in these
              groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also specify which groups to automatically require through the parameters to
              <code>Bundler.require</code>. The <code>:default</code> group includes all gems not
              listed under any group. If you call <code>Bundler.require(:default, :development)</code>,
              bundler will <code>require</code> all the gems in the <code>:default</code> group, as
              well as the gems in the <code>:development</code> group.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, a Rails generated app calls <code>Bundler.require(:default,&#x000A;    Rails.env)</code> in your <code>application.rb</code>, which links the groups in your
              <code>Gemfile</code> to the Rails environment. If you use other groups (not linked to a
              Rails environment), you can add them to the call to <code>Bundler.require</code>, if you
              want them to be automatically required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that you can always leave groups of gems out of <code>Bundler.require</code>,
              and then require them manually using Ruby's <code>require</code> at the appropriate
              place in your app. You might do this because requiring a certain gem takes some time,
              and you don't need it every time you boot your application.
            </p>
            <h2 id='checking-your-code-into-version-control'>
              Checking Your Code into Version Control
            </h2>
            <p>
              After developing your application for a while, check in the application together with
              the <code>Gemfile</code> and <code>Gemfile.lock</code> snapshot. Now, your repository
              has a record of the exact versions of all of the gems that you used the last time you
              know for sure that the application worked. Keep in mind that while your
              <code>Gemfile</code> lists only three gems (with varying degrees of version strictness),
              your application depends on dozens of gems, once you take into consideration all of the
              implicit requirements of the gems you depend on.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is important: <strong>the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> makes your application a single
              package of both your own code and the third-party code it ran the last time you know for
              sure that everything worked</strong>. Specifying exact versions of the third-party code
              you depend on in your <code>Gemfile</code> would not provide the same guarantee, because
              gems usually declare a range of versions for their dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next time you run <code>bundle install</code> on the same machine, bundler will see
              that it already has all of the dependencies you need, and skip the installation process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not check in the <code>.bundle</code> directory, or any of the files inside it. Those
              files are specific to each particular machine, and are used to persist installation options
              between runs of the <code>bundle install</code> command.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have run <code>bundle pack</code>, the gems (although not the git gems) required
              by your bundle will be downloaded into <code>vendor/cache</code>. Bundler can run without
              connecting to the internet (or the RubyGems server) if all the gems you need are present
              in that folder and checked in to your source control. This is an <strong>optional</strong>
              step, and not recommended, due to the increase in size of your source control repository.
            </p>
            <h2 id='sharing-your-application-with-other-developers'>
              Sharing Your Application With Other Developers
            </h2>
            <p>
              When your co-developers (or you on another machine) check out your code, it will come
              with the exact versions of all the third-party code your application used on the machine
              that you last developed on (in the <code>Gemfile.lock</code>). When **they** run
              <code>bundle install</code>, bundler will find the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> and skip
              the dependency resolution step. Instead, it will install all of the same gems that you
              used on the original machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, you don't have to guess which versions of the dependencies you should
              install. In the example we've been using, even though <code>rack-cache</code> declares a
              dependency on <code>rack >= 0.4</code>, we know for sure it works with <code>rack&#x000A;    1.2.1</code>. Even if the Rack team releases <code>rack 1.2.2</code>, bundler will
              always install <code>1.2.1</code>, the exact version of the gem that we know works. This
              relieves a large maintenance burden from application developers, because all machines
              always run the exact same third-party code.
            </p>
            <h2 id='updating-a-dependency'>
              Updating a Dependency
            </h2>
            <p>
              Of course, at some point, you might want to update the version of a particular
              dependency your application relies on. For instance, you might want to update
              <code>rails</code> to <code>3.0.0</code> final. Importantly, just because you're
              updating one dependency, it doesn't mean you want to re-resolve all of your dependencies
              and use the latest version of everything. In our example, you only have three
              dependencies, but even in this case, updating everything can cause complications.
            </p>
            <p>
              To illustrate, the <code>rails 3.0.0.rc</code> gem depends on <code>actionpack&#x000A;    3.0.0.rc</code> gem, which depends on <code>rack ~> 1.2.1</code> (which means <code>>=&#x000A;    1.2.1</code> and <code>< 1.3.0</code>). The <code>rack-cache</code> gem depends on
              <code>rack >= 0.4</code>. Let's assume that the <code>rails 3.0.0</code> final gem also
              depends on <code>rack ~> 1.2.1</code>, and that since the release of <code>rails&#x000A;    3.0.0</code>, the Rack team released <code>rack 1.2.2</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we naïvely update all of our gems in order to update Rails, we'll get <code>rack&#x000A;    1.2.2</code>, which satisfies the requirements of both <code>rails 3.0.0</code> and
              <code>rack-cache</code>. However, we didn't specifically ask to update
              <code>rack-cache</code>, which may not be compatible with <code>rack 1.2.2</code> (for
              whatever reason). And while an update from <code>rack 1.2.1</code> to <code>rack&#x000A;    1.2.2</code> probably won't break anything, similar scenarios can happen that involve
              much larger jumps. (see [1] below for a larger discussion)
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to avoid this problem, when you update a gem, bundler will not update a
              dependency of that gem if another gem still depends on it. In this example, since
              <code>rack-cache</code> still depends on <code>rack</code>, bundler will not update the
              <code>rack</code> gem. This ensures that updating <code>rails</code> doesn't
              inadvertently break <code>rack-cache</code>. Since <code>rails 3.0.0</code>'s dependency
              <code>actionpack 3.0.0</code> remains compatible with <code>rack 1.2.1</code>, bundler
              leaves it alone, and <code>rack-cache</code> continues to work even in the face of an
              incompatibility with <code>rack 1.2.2</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since you originally declared a dependency on <code>rails 3.0.0.rc</code>, if you want
              to update to <code>rails 3.0.0</code>, simply update your <code>Gemfile</code> to
              <code>gem 'rails', '3.0.0'</code> and run:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              As described above, the <code>bundle install</code> command always does a conservative
              update, refusing to update gems (or their dependencies) that you have not explicitly
              changed in the <code>Gemfile</code>. This means that if you do not modify
              <code>rack-cache</code> in your <code>Gemfile</code>, bundler will treat it **and its
              dependencies** (<code>rack</code>) as a single, unmodifiable unit. If <code>rails&#x000A;    3.0.0</code> was incompatible with <code>rack-cache</code>, bundler will report a
              conflict between your snapshotted dependencies (<code>Gemfile.lock</code>) and your
              updated <code>Gemfile</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you update your <code>Gemfile</code>, and your system already has all of the needed
              dependencies, bundler will transparently update the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> when you
              boot your application. For instance, if you add <code>mysql</code> to your
              <code>Gemfile</code>, and have already installed it in your system, you can boot your
              application without running <code>bundle install</code>, and bundler will persist the
              "last known good" configuration to the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> snapshot.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can come in handy when adding or updating gems with minimal dependencies (database
              drivers, <code>wirble</code>, <code>ruby-debug</code>). It will probably fail if you
              update gems with significant dependencies (<code>rails</code>), or that a lot of gems
              depend on (<code>rack</code>). If a transparent update fails, your application will fail
              to boot, and bundler will print out an error instructing you to run <code>bundle&#x000A;    install</code>.

              Updating a Gem Without Modifying the Gemfile
            </h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes, you want to update a dependency without modifying the Gemfile. For example,
              you might want to update to the latest version of <code>rack-cache</code>. Because you
              did not declare a specific version of <code>rack-cache</code> in the
              <code>Gemfile</code>, you might want to periodically get the latest version of
              <code>rack-cache</code>. To do this, you want to use the <code>bundle update</code>
              command:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle update rack-cache&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              This command will update <code>rack-cache</code> and its dependencies to the latest
              version allowed by the <code>Gemfile</code> (in this case, the latest version
              available). It will not modify any other dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              It will, however, update dependencies of other gems if necessary. For instance, if the
              latest version of <code>rack-cache</code> specifies a dependency on <code>rack >=&#x000A;    1.2.2</code>, bundler will update <code>rack</code> to <code>1.2.2</code> even though
              you have not asked bundler to update <code>rack</code>. If bundler needs to update a
              gem that another gem depends on, it will let you know after the update has completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to update every gem in the Gemfile to the latest possible versions, run:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle update&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              This will resolve dependencies from scratch, ignoring the <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. If
              you do this, keep <code>git reset --hard</code> and your test suite in your back pocket.
              Resolving all dependencies from scratch can have surprising results, especially if a
              number of the third-party packages you depend on have released new versions since you
              last did a full update.
            </p>
            <h2 id='deploying-your-application'>
              Deploying Your Application
            </h2>
            <p>
              When you run <code>bundle install</code>, bundler will (by default), install your gems
              to your system repository of gems. This means that they will show up in <code>gem&#x000A;    list</code>. Additionally, if you are developing a number of applications, you will not
              need to download and install gems in common for each application. This is nice for
              development, but somewhat problematic for deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a deployment scenario, the Unix user you deploy with may not have access to install
              gems to a system location. Even if the user does (or you use <code>sudo</code>), the
              user that boots the application may not have access to them. For instance, Passenger
              runs its Ruby subprocesses with the user <code>nobody</code>, a somewhat restricted
              user. The tradeoffs in a deployment environment lean more heavily in favor of isolation
              (even at the cost of a somewhat slower deploy-time <code>bundle install</code> when some
              third-party dependencies have changed).
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, bundler comes with a <code>--deployment</code> flag that encapsulates the
              best practices for using bundler in a deployment environment. These practices are based
              on significant feedback we have received during the development of bundler, as well as a
              number of bug reports that mostly reflected a misunderstanding of how to best configure
              bundler for deployment. The <code>--deployment</code> flags adds the following defaults:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Instead of installing gems to the system location, bundler will install gems to
                <code>vendor/bundle</code> inside your application. Bundler will transparently remember
                this location when you invoke it inside your application (with
                <code>Bundler.setup</code> and <code>Bundler.require</code>).
              </li>
              <li>
                Bundler will not use gems already installed to your system, even if they exist.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have run <code>bundle pack</code>, checked in the <code>vendor/cache</code>
                directory, and do not have any git gems, Bundler will not contact the internet while
                installing your bundle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bundler will require a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> snapshot, and fail if you did not
                provide one.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bundler will not transparently update your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> if it is out of
                date with your <code>Gemfile</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you use Capistrano, you should symlink <code>vendor/bundle</code> to
              <code>shared/vendor_bundle</code> so that bundler will share your installed gems between
              deployments (making things zippy if you didn't make any changes), but still give you the
              benefits of isolation from other applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              By defaulting the bundle directory to <code>vendor/bundle</code>, and installing your
              bundle as part of your deployment process, you can be sure that the same Unix user that
              checked out your application also installed the third-party code your application needs.
              This means that if Passenger (or Unicorn) can see your application, it can also see its
              dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>--deployment</code> flag requires an up-to-date <code>Gemfile.lock</code> to
              ensure that the testing you have done (in development and staging) actually reflects the
              code you put into production. You can run <code>bundle check</code> before deploying
              your application to make sure that your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> is up-to-date. Note
              that it will always be up-to-date if you have run <code>bundle install</code>,
              successfully booted your application (or run your tests) since the last time you changed
              your <code>Gemfile</code>.

              FAQ: Why Can't I Just Specify Only <code>=</code> Dependencies?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> I understand the value of locking my gems down to specific versions,
              but why can't I just specify <code>=</code> versions for all my dependencies in the
              <code>Gemfile</code> and forget about the <code>Gemfile.lock</code>?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A:</strong> Many of your gems will have their own dependencies, and they are
              unlikely to specify <code>=</code> dependencies. Moreover, it is probably unwise for
              gems to lock down all of *their* dependencies so strictly. The <code>Gemfile.lock</code>
              allows you to specify the versions of the dependencies that your application needs in
              the <code>Gemfile</code>, while remembering all of the exact versions of third-party
              code that your application used when it last worked correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              By specifying looser dependencies in your <code>Gemfile</code> (such as
              <code>nokogiri ~> 1.4.2</code>), you gain the ability to run
              <code>bundle update nokogiri</code>, and let bundler handle updating **only**
              <code>nokogiri</code> and its dependencies to the latest version that still
              satisfied the <code>~> 1.4.2</code> version requirement. This
              also allows you to say "I want to use the current version of nokogiri" (<code>gem&#x000A;    'nokogiri'</code> in your <code>Gemfile</code>) without having to look up the exact
              version number, while still getting the benefits of ensuring that your application
              always runs with exactly the same versions of all third-party code.

              FAQ: Why Can't I Just Submodule Everything?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> I don't understand why I need bundler to manage my gems in this
              manner. Why can't I just get the gems I need and stick them in submodules, then put each
              of the submodules on the load path?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, that solution requires that you manually resolve all
              of the dependencies in your application, including dependencies of dependencies. And
              even once you do that successfully, you would need to redo that work if you wanted to
              update a particular gem. For instance, if you wanted to update the <code>rails</code>
              gem, you would need to find all of the gems that depended on dependencies of Rails
              (<code>rack</code>, <code>erubis</code>, <code>i18n</code>, <code>tzinfo</code>, etc.),
              and find new versions that satisfy the new versions of Rails' requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frankly, this is the sort of problem that computers are good at, and which you, a
              developer, should not need to spend time doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              More concerningly, if you made a mistake in the manual dependency resolution process,
              you would not get any feedback about conflicts between different dependencies, resulting
              in subtle runtime errors. For instance, if you accidentally stuck the wrong version of
              <code>rack</code> in a submodule, it would likely break at runtime, when Rails or
              another dependency tried to rely on a method that was not present.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bottom line: even though it might seem simpler at first glance, it is decidedly
              significantly more complex.

              FAQ: Why Is Bundler Downloading Gems From <code>--without</code> Groups?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> I ran <code>bundle install --without production</code> and bundler
              is still downloading the gems in the <code>:production</code> group. Why?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A:</strong> Bundler's <code>Gemfile.lock</code> has to contain exact versions of all
              dependencies in your <code>Gemfile</code>, regardless of any options you pass in. If it
              did not, deploying your application to production might change all your dependencies,
              eliminating the benefit of Bundler. You could no longer be sure that your application
              uses the same gems in production that you used to develop and test with. Additionally,
              adding a dependency in production might result in an application that is impossible to
              deploy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, imagine you have a production-only gem (let's call it
              <code>rack-debugging</code>) that depends on <code>rack =1.1</code>. If we did not
              evaluate the production group when you ran <code>bundle install --without&#x000A;    production</code>, you would deploy your application, only to receive an error that
              <code>rack-debugging</code> conflicted with <code>rails</code> (which depends on
              <code>actionpack</code>, which depends on <code>rack ~> 1.2.1</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another example: imagine a simple Rack application that has <code>gem 'rack'</code> in
              the <code>Gemfile</code>. Again, imagine that you put <code>rack-debugging</code> in the
              <code>:production</code> group. If we did not evaluate the <code>:production</code>
              group when you installed via <code>bundle install --without production</code>, your app
              would use <code>rack 1.2.1</code> in development, and you would learn, at deployment
              time, that <code>rack-debugging</code> conflicts with the version of Rack that you
              tested with.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, by evaluating the gems in **all** groups when you call <code>bundle&#x000A;    install</code>, regardless of the groups you actually want to use in that environment,
              we will discover the <code>rack-debugger</code> requirement, and install <code>rack&#x000A;    1.1</code>, which is also compatible with the <code>gem 'rack'</code> requirement in
              your <code>Gemfile</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, by always evaluating all of the dependencies in your Gemfile, regardless of
              the dependencies you intend to use in a particular environment, you avoid nasty
              surprises when switching to a different set of groups in a different environment. And
              because we just download (but do not install) the gems, you won't have to worry about
              the possibility of a difficult **installation** process for a gem that you only use in
              production (or in development).

            <p>
              <strong>Q</strong>: I have a C extension gem, such as <code>mysql</code>, which requires
              special flags in order to compile and install. How can I pass these flags into the
              installation process for those gems?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A</strong>: First of all, this problem does not exist for the
              <code>mysql2</code> gem, which is a drop-in replacement for the <code>mysql</code> gem.
              In general, modern C extensions properly discover the needed headers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you really need to pass flags to a C extension, you can use the <code>bundle&#x000A;    config</code> command:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle config build.mysql --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config&#x000A;</pre>
            <p>
              Bundler will store this configuration in <code>~/.bundle/config</code>, and bundler will
              use the configuration for any <code>bundle install</code> performed by the same user. As
              a result, once you specify the necessary build flags for a gem, you can successfully
              install that gem as many times as necessary.

                <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install&#x000A;</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  To update a gem's version requirements, first modify the Gemfile:
                </p>
                <pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'sinatra'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.0.0'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rack-cache'</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rack-bug'</span>&#x000A;</pre>
                <p>
                  and then run:
                </p>
                <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install&#x000A;</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <code>bundle install</code> reports a conflict between your <code>Gemfile</code>
                  and <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, run:
                </p>
                <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle update sinatra&#x000A;</pre>
                <p>
                  This will update just the Sinatra gem, as well as any of its dependencies
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  To update all of the gems in your <code>Gemfile</code> to the latest possible
                  versions, run:
                </p>
                <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle update&#x000A;</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                Whenever your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> changes, always check it in to version
                control. It keeps a history of the exact versions of all third-party code that you
                used to successfully run your application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When deploying your code to a staging or production server, first run your tests (or
                  boot your local development server), make sure you have checked in your
                  <code>Gemfile.lock</code> to version control. On the remote server, run:
                </p>
                <pre class="highlight plaintext">$ bundle install --deployment&#x000A;</pre>
              </li>
            </ul>

              Notes
            </h2>
            <p>
              [1] For instance, if <code>rails 3.0.0</code> depended on <code>rack 2.0</code>, that
              gem would still satisfy the requirement of <code>rack-cache</code>, which declares
              <code>>= 1.0</code> as a dependency. Of course, you could argue that
              <code>rack-cache</code> is silly for depending on open-ended versions, but these
              situations exist (extensively) in the wild, and projects often find themselves between a
              rock and a hard place when deciding what version to depend on. Constrain the dependency
              too much (<code>rack =1.2.1</code>) and you make it hard to use your project in other
              compatible projects. Constrain it too little (<code>rack >= 1.0</code>) and a new
              release of Rack may break your code. Using dependencies like <code>rack ~> 1.2.1</code>
              and versioning code in a SemVer compliant way mostly solves this problem, but it assumes
              universal compliance. Since RubyGems has over 100,000 packages, this assumption simply
              doesn't hold in practice.
